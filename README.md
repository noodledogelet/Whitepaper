Guys you bought a coin based off a dog with a head shaped like a bicycle seat. What utility did you expect? 

In an ideal world we'll have NFTs of various hounds with rarities encoded released and they will all 100x in 1 week so all Noodle Doge <s>degens</s> investors can write "Noodle Doge Millionaire" on their Twitter profiles and spend all day retweeting memes and shit. The value of Noodle Doge is in <b>YOUR</b> hands. If you shill it like it's the next Shib then it well could be, if you think it's a shitcoin then it just is.

WE ARE ONLY AS STRONG AS OUR COMMUNITY.

If anything, I'd be really interested to see how history books will describe the crypto memecoin frenzy that we're experiencing now. Hopefully we're all billionaires chilling in the Spacex lounge while waiting for takeoff. It's just nice to dream anyway, eh?
