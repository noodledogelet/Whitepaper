Guys you bought a coin based off a dog with a head shaped like a bicycle seat. What utility did you expect? 

In an ideal world we'll have NFTs of various hounds with rarities encoded released and they will all 100x in 1 week so all Noodle Doge <s>degens</s> investors can write "Noodle Doge Millionaire" on their Twitter profiles and spend all day retweeting memes and shit. The value of Noodle Doge is in <b>YOUR</b> hands. If you shill it like it's the next Shib then it well could be, if you think it's a shitcoin then it just is.

WE ARE ONLY AS STRONG AS OUR COMMUNITY.
